The team participates in national and international SAE events where the mechanical design and the vehicle’s performance is evaluated by undergoing a series of on-site tests, such as obstacle courses. I have been a member of the team since august 2019 where my main role was addressing the vehicle’s steering system. Initially my main contribution was noticing that the vehicle had difficulty steering when a tight turn was involved. After some research I came to the conclusion that the ackermann angle had been calculated inaccurately and what had resulted was an anti-ackermann configuration in the steering geometry. The solution was to simply correct the geometry to a positive Ackermann configuration resulting a smaller turning radius. 
During the period of  Jan-2022 and Jun-2022 I became the vice president and founded alternative branch (Telemetry) with the objective wireless sensory systems, and collecting data from the subsystems of the vehicle; therefore, correlating the collected information with the simulated designs and preforming modifications accordingly. 
The system estimates the vehicle's velocity in real time.
The system consists of three photoelectric sensors mounted to camera like structures (made in house)
