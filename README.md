Founded alternative branch (Telemetry) for the team with the objective of collecting data from the subsystems of the vehicle; therefore, correlating the collected information with the simulated designs and preforming modifications accordingly
The system estimates the vehicle's velocity in real time.
The system consists of three fotoelectric sensors mounted to camera like structures (made in house)
